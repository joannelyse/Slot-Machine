This is a project from a Youtube Tutorial I followed called "Learn Python With This ONE Project!" by the channel Tech with Tim. I had learn many concepts from this video in my Introduction to programming in python course but felt I could never truly apply it or grasp it. This project helped me understand the material more. It's very interesting to see the order of these functions and the technicality of real world concepts translated into code.
